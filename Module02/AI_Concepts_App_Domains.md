# Module 02 – AI Concepts, Terminology & Application Domains

##  Overview
This module dives into the foundational building blocks of AI: from cognitive computing to machine learning styles, from deep learning architectures to real-world applications like NLP,
computer vision, and autonomous systems.


## 1. Cognitive Computing & Intelligent Agents
- **Cognitive computing** mimics human thinking—reasoning, remembering, learning through interaction, and handling ambiguous data.  
- **Intelligent agents** perceive their environment, act autonomously to achieve goals, and can adapt via learning. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 2. Machine Learning (ML) vs Deep Learning (DL)
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: AI systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed—growing in performance over time. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: An advanced form of ML using multi-layered neural networks to process raw data (text, images) and uncover patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 3. Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Generative AI** creates new content—text, images, video—by learning patterns from vast datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Tools like **ChatGPT, Gemini, DALL·E, Midjourney** are powered by transformative **LLMs** and generative models. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 4. Application Domains
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Computers read, understand, and generate human language.  
- **Speech Processing**: Includes converting spoken words to text (STT) and the reverse (TTS).  
- **Computer Vision**: AI systems interpret visual data (images, video), e.g. object detection. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Self-Driving Cars / Autonomous Systems**: Combine these tools to perceive, decide, and act in physical environments.


## 5. AI + IoT + Cloud + Edge – Smart Ecosystems
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Network of devices collecting data from the real world.  
- **Cloud Computing**: Stores and processes data on remote servers.  
- **Edge Computing**: Processes data locally (near the data source) to reduce delay and bandwidth. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Together, they form intelligent, responsive systems like smart traffic, agriculture, and buildings.

##  Quick Reference – Understanding AI Tools

| Tool / Model | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `Cognitive Computing` | Mimics how humans think and reason |
| `ML / DL` | Learns patterns from data; DL processes complex, raw inputs |
| `Generative AI / LLMs` | Generates new text, images, and creative output |
| `NLP / Speech / Vision` | Understands language, voice, and visual inputs |
| `Autonomous Systems` | Intelligent machines that perceive and act |
| `IoT + Cloud + Edge` | Infrastructure for smart, real-time AI applications |


##  Why This Module Matters
You now understand how AI “thinks”—from high-level reasoning to advanced content creation—and how it powers real-world applications.
This foundation is key as you continue building your own AI tools and documenting your journey in your GitHub portfolio.
